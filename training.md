For the upcoming season, I have picked a few new challenges already which means a few changes to my training for the off-season.

First, I have decided that I want to try my hand at the [[http://stlouisultrarunnersgroup.net/?page_id=13|Chubb trail run]] in April. So a big chunk of my training over the next few months is going to center around prepping for trail running 25km. Since I've not been running much over the past few years, December and January are planned out for some "base" running. This will mostly 2 runs per week (sometimes 3) and hopefully a trail run or two. Much of this running will be at an easy pace (about 10 minute miles), but I am also doing the Frostbite run series so a few will be faster pace runs. Almost all of these runs will be 2-5 miles long.

Starting in February I hope to start some more specific mileage-prep runs. I'll be doing 3 runs per week with one long run on weekends.
