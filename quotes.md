"Like the newspapers used to say, if the truth isn't big enough, you print the legend. This country needs its legends. And even the legends don't believe it anymore." - American Gods, Neil Gaiman

"I didn't understand where this man had come from, this lion who'd replaced my docile, frail excuse for a parent. A lion protecting his cubs. He knew that fear was the only weapon he had left to save my life and if I didn't fear the threat of the plague, then dammit, I was going to fear him!" - World War Z, Max Brooks

"You can't blame anyone else, not the plan's architect, not your commanding officer, no one but yourself. You have to make your own choices and live every agonizing day with the consequences of those choices. He knew this. That's why he deserted us like we deserted those civilians. He saw the road ahead, a steep, treacherous mountain road. We'd all have to hike that road, each of us dragging the boulder of what we'd done behind us. He couldn't do it. He couldn't shoulder the weight." – World War Z, Max Brooks

"So why did you film them?"  
"Because Americans worship technology. It's an inherent trait in the national zeitgeist. Whether we realize it or not, even the most indefatigable Luddite can't deny our country's technoprowess. We split the atom, we reached the moon, we've filled every household and business with more gadgets and gizmos than early sci-fi writers could have ever dreamed of. I don't know if that's a good thing. I'm in no place to judge. But I do know that just like all those ex-atheists in foxholes, most Americans were still praying for the God of science to save them." – World War Z, Max Brooks

"Yes, they were lies and sometimes that's not a bad thing. Lies are neither bad nor good. Like a fire they can either keep you warm or burn you to death, depending on how they're used." – World War Z, Max Brooks

"She never let up, never gave me an inch. 'What are you, some weak little victim?' At that point I thought I was. I knew I could never make it. The exhaustion, the pain, more than anything, I think, the anger at fucking up so badly. I actually considered turning my pistol around, wanting to punish myself for ... you know. And then Mets really hit me. She roared, 'What are you, your fucking mother!?!'" – World War Z, Max Brooks

"Maybe she wasn't a pilot herself, maybe she was married to one, maybe she'd wanted to be one but never made it as far as I did. Maybe she was just scared, lonely voice that did what she could to help another scared lonely voice from ending up like her. Who cares who she was, or is? She was there when I needed her, and for the rest of my life, she'll always be with me." – World War Z, Max Brooks

"If you asked every engineer at NASA what the worst scenario for the Hab was, they'd all answer 'fire.' If you asked them what the result would be, they'd answer 'death by fire.'" – The Martian, Andy Weir

"Yes, these new young people, of the rising generation, who did not remember the days before the war or even the war itself – they were the hope of the world. Place difference did not have the significance to them.  
"It will end, Childan thought. Someday. The very idea of place. Not governed and governing, but people." – The Man in the High Castle, Philip K Dick

"I believe he's got a lot of courage to write that book. If the Axis had lost the war, we'd be able to say and write anything we wanted, like we used to; we'd be one country and we'd have a fair legal system, the same one for all of us." – The Man in the High Castle, Philip K Dick

"[S]he wondered, wondered, shuffling back through a fat deckful of days which seemed (wouldn't she be first to admit?) more or less identical, or all pointed the same way subtly like a conjurer's deck, any odd one readily clear to a trained eye." – The Crying of Lot 49, Thomas Pynchon

"Yet at least he had believed in the cars. Maybe to excess: how could he not, seeing people poorer than him come in, Negro, Mexican, cracker, a parade seven days a week, bringing the most godawful of trade-ins: motorized, metal extensions of themselves, of their families and what their whole lives must be like, out there so naked for anybody, a stranger like himself, to look at, frame cockeyed, rusty underneath, fender repainted in a shade just off enough to depress the value, if not Mucho himself, inside smelling hopelessly of children, supermaket booze, two, sometimes three generations of cigarette smokers, or only of dust–and when the cars were swept out you had to look at the actual residue of these lives, and there was no way of telling what things had been truly refused (when so little he supposed came by that out of feat most of it had to be taken and kept) and what had simply (perhaps tragically) been lost... it make him sick to look, but he had to look." – The Crying of Lot 49, Thomas Pynchon

"Even if enough exposure to the unvarying gray sickness had somehow managed to immunize him, he could still never accept the way each owner, each shadow, filed in only to exchange a dented, malfunctioning version of himself for another, just as futureless, automotive projection of somebody ele's life. As if it were the most natural thing. to Mucho it was horrible. Endless, convoluted incest." – The Crying of Lot 49, Thomas Pynchon
