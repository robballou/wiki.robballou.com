  * Mud!
  * First lap felt pretty good for about 50% - 75% of the lap
  * Passed several riders
  * Tried an 'attack' on the grassy hill, but lost it after the drop to the second grassy single track (which was muddy)
  * Finished out of sight of #1
  * Lap 2 I&nbsp;suffered pretty badly on pacing, falling to 3rd based on the lap time and losing 4:30 minutes over previous lap
  * Wasn't able to feed during the entire race (had some water though, muddy as it was)
  * //If I raced sport:// I would have finished 5/9
