====== 2012 Goals ======

===== Food and Drink =====

Last year, I made strides to have 2 days per week without meat, plus just generally trying to cut down on meat-centric meals. The bigger idea behind this goal was to concentrate on getting vegetables into my diet. While I may not have always made it last year, I think this definitely opened up new meals and new ideas about what should be a meal. This year I'm continuing this goal but "reworking" it into this:

  * 7 lunch/dinner meals per week should be vegetarian.
  * 5 breakfast meals should be vegetarian. Typically not an issue as my breakfast meals tend to be carb-centric.

The following goals are designed around the idea of eating better food and to help meet my "selective vegetarianism". Also trying to get to the point of eating food that I have cooked rather than the convenience of getting food from other places (not to mention, maybe saving money).

  * Only 1 lunch out per week
  * Only 1 dinner out per week (meals with friends may be excluded ;))
  * Only 1 breakfast out per week

===== Exercise =====

  * Commute 1/week
  * Run 1/week
  * Yoga 2/week
  * Complete trail run 25k
  * Trail run CBL for 13.1mi
  * 2 backpacking trips
