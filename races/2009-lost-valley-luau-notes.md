  * During first lap grounded out in three spots: at the rock garden "bump", after someone fell on the other side of the garden, and at the water fall
  * Felt heart rate hit max on the climb to the cedars and stopped to let other riders pass while I'rested briefly
  * Mostly caught up to #1 in the double track and the waterfall climb (and because of the kids race)
  * Finished within sight of #1 at lap one
  * Was totally destroyed starting the second lap
  * Dropped 1 minute in total during lap 2
  * //If I'raced sport:// I'would have finished last (12/12)
