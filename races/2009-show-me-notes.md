  * Fun course, rutted and technical in a few places with roots and rocks. Thought I was going to eat it at least once in the rough, loose rock.
  * Hill climbs are not too bad
  * Long flat section was fast (like river at CW). Probably could have hammered a bit more down in the flats
  * Grass section was tough, a bit slow and mostly up hill
  * While my stats show a comparable ride to Springfield, I don't feel as tired, maybe should have pushed more?
