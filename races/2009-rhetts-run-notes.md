  * Not my race at all! Rained before the race started and the trail was slick and technical. Felt out place in the first lap, heart rate was elevated, etc.
  * Stuck behind a new racer that was struggling through the course (who ended up finished 2nd)
  * First lap was 2 minutes slower than my dry-run, not race pace lap from week before
  * Need to practice remounts! This killed my chances at 2nd.
  * If I was racing sport: Would have finished in 10/12
